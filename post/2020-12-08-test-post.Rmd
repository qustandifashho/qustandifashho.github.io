#Python Code along with R-Code
##Here I am looking at the Quakes dataset. I made a histogram and boxplot showing the magnitude data points. This part was done in R. They do not seem normally distributed at all. And I also tan mean(quakes$mag) to get the average of mags and got 4.6204
```{r}
head(quakes)
hist(quakes$mag)
boxplot(quakes$mag)
mean(quakes$mag)
quakes<- quakes
```

The first code chunk is that of python. I loaded the "quakes" dataset

## Communication of R code with Python

The second and third code chunk is that of Python and R-strudio communicating with each other. I found the mean of magnitude in the quakes data set which is 4.6204000000000001. This is the same mean as I calculated in R for Magnitude 

```{python}
r.quakes.mag.mean()
r.quakes.mag.median()

```
