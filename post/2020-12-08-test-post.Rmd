#Python Code along with R-Code

The first code chunk is that of python. I loaded the "quakes" dataset

## Communication of R code with Python

The second and third code chunk is that of python and R-strudio communicating with each other. I found the mean of magnitude in the quakes data set which is 4.6204000000000001


```{r}
quakes<- quakes
```

```{python}
r.quakes.mag.mean()

```
